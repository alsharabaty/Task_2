Task 2 in Git & GitHub Workshop
-------------------------------

Once upon a time, in a village named "Init", lived a brave adventurer
named Git.

Git was well-known for his curiosity and eagerness to learn.
He had one dream - to explore the mysterious world of Version Control.

Git, after much contemplation, decided to leave his home in Init to
explore the vast world of Version Control.

With a heavy heart and a bag full of hopes, Git took his first step
into the world unknown.
